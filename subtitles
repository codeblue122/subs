Never knew how to deal this social maze,
but mind won't amend its ways.

Ways of my life have changed...

 Bigger gemstones get chiseled most"

 Meaning, "The smaller we are, the better the life."

 Listen, we are closing school early today but return to home only.
 Don't roam around in town.
I should not catch you roaming anywhere.
