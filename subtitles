 Ways of my life have changed,

Time is shaping new words,garbs and new days
Never knew how to deal this social maze
but mind won't amend its ways.

Ways of my life have changed,
but mind wont change its ways.

But Why can't we go ?
Mother said, ghosts and wolves are there.

You think really?

What would you do if a ghost shows up?

Well, pelt it with stones.

Why rushing aunty, seen a ghost?

Not ghost, a drunkard over there.

Hey, why you bothering that woman?

Hey come with me, let me drop you home.
Dust devil (Chakri) will catch you else.

Really? Ask dustdevil to fly you home,
otherwise you will stay here forever.

 He says,"Return my childhood oh lord, the pleasure of small things.
 Bigger gemstones get chiseled most"

 Meaning, "The smaller we are, the better the life."

 Listen, we are closing school early today but return to home only.
 Don't roam around in town.
I should not catch you roaming anywhere.

Look at that

Dustdevil!

Enough, let's go home.

You run towards home now.


Something is off today right?
What?

I don't remember keeping these paisas, don't remember when I put them in pocket.

Do you think the candy seller died due to this money ?

Shouldn't have touched the funeral procession money, it could be cursed.

Lets throw this money back and ask for forgiveness.
